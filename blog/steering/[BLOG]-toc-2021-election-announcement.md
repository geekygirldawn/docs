Itâ€™s time to kick off the Knative Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) elections
again for 2021, and we are ready to accept nominations!

This election will shape the future of Knative as a community and project. While
WGs help shape the individual direction of the project, the [TOC covers the
technical direction, health of the project and community as a
whole](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md#charter).
There are 2
seats up for election and each of those seats will be held for two year terms.

Right now, there are 2 things we need each Knative community member to do:

1) If you want to stand for election, we have [detailed instructions for the
nomination
process](https://github.com/knative/community/tree/main/elections/2021-TOC#candidacy-process).
2) If
you want to vote in the election, please read the [eligibility
criteria](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/mechanics/TOC.md#voter-eligibility). If you think you are eligible to vote, please make sure that your GitHub id appears
in the voters.yaml file, and if not, please use the [voter exception
process](https://github.com/knative/community/tree/main/elections/2021-TOC)
in our voting tool, Elekto.

Here are a few important deadlines to keep in mind:

- April 23: All candidate nominations and voting exceptions due
- April 27: Election Begins
- May 11: Election Closes
- May 13: Announcement of Results

For this election, we will be trying a new voting tool called Elekto.
Commissioned by the CNCF for the Kubernetes project, Elekto has the advantage of
not requiring any email for voting, just your Github login.  However, this will
be the first time a project other than Kubernetes is using Elekto, so please be
prepared for some hiccups.

For more details, please visit the [TOC election](
https://github.com/knative/community/tree/main/elections/2021-TOC) document in
our GitHub repository.

Dawn Foster and Josh Berkus, TOC Election Officers
